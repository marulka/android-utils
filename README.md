Every developer needs a tools set which can saves him a lot of time writing a same code blocks and/or checks on and on. One of the common things that you should do, 
in case you want to have a fail-safe program, is to check each time you call an objects function for a Null Pointer. The NullPointerException is most common mistake 
every developer does. The Andoid-Utils library gives you easy and flexible solution, which may helps you, like makes your code safer. It definitely will save your time, 
and even more, will helps you much more easier to debug your code.
